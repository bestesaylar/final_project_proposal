# final_project_proposal

The goal od this project is to create awareness on misinformation by making reference to fake news. An interactive web application which gets data from a news API, anf by using text-based generative model I can create fake news. 

INSPIRATION
Lots of things you read online especially in your social media feeds may appear to be true, often is not. Fake news is news, stories or hoaxes created to deliberately misinform or deceive readers. 
Traditionally we got our news from trusted sources, journalists and media outlets that are required to follow strict codes of practice. However, the internet has enabled a whole new way to publish, share and consume information and news with very little regulation or editorial standards.
Usually, these stories are created to either influence people’s views, push a political agenda or cause confusion and can often be a profitable business for online publishers.
My hometown Turkey is a country where fact and fiction are increasingly hard to distinguish. It is little wonder that Turkey ranks first in a list of countries where people complain about completely made-up stories. according to this year's Reuters Digital News Report.
